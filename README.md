# Aptos Labels

Known addresses on Aptos mainnet with human-readable labels.

## Source

Labels are fetched from the [Aptos Explorer](https://github.com/aptos-labs/explorer/blob/main/src/constants.tsx) `knownAddresses` object.

## Update

Run the fetch script to get the latest labels:

```bash
node fetch-labels.mjs > mainnet.json
```
